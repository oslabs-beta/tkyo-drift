// TODO: Need to make the logic to:
// 1. Get the data from the CLI log file
// 2. Filter it to show the relevant time period
// 3. compute some % to show # of drifts during that time period
// 4. print to console
// ? Should we make a log of CLI queries? 
// Do we want to keep track of previous results
